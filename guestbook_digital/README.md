# ðŸ“˜ `guestbook_digital` â€“ Blockchain-Based Digital Guestbook

Welcome to the **guestbook\_digital** project!
This is a blockchain-based digital guestbook application built on the **Internet Computer**, where users can write their name and a message that will be stored permanently on-chain.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description

This application is developed using the **Motoko** language and runs on the Internet Computer platform.
Its purpose is to learn the basics of **actors** in Motoko, how to store data in actor variables, and how to use **arrays** and **records or types** effectively.

### âœ¨ Key Features

* âœ… `addEntry(name: Text, message: Text)`
  Adds a new guestbook entry with the provided name and message.

* âœ… `getEntries() : [Person]`
  Returns all guestbook entries that have been added.

### ðŸ§± Data Structure

```motoko
type Person = {
  name: Text;
  message: Text;  
};
```

All entries are stored in an array within the Motoko actor.
